```

## Next Steps (Optional)

### 1. Connect Real Data

The pages currently show sample data. To connect to real backend APIs:

- Update dashboard pages to fetch data from API routes
- Add React state management for user interactions
- Implement form submissions for create/update operations

### 2. Add Authentication Protection

- Update middleware.ts to protect routes
- Add session checks to pages
- Redirect unauthenticated users to signin

### 3. Database Setup

If you want to use the full backend functionality:

```bash
# Configure your Supabase connection in .env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://..."

# Push the schema to your database
npm run db:push

# Seed initial data
npm run db:seed
```

### 4. Configure External Services

- **Email**: Set up SMTP for magic link authentication
- **Stripe**: Add your Stripe API keys for payment processing
- **Redis** (optional): Configure Upstash for rate limiting
